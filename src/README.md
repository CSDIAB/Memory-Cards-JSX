What components are we working with?

- cards for sure - but do we need one for flipped and matched as well?
  for now focus on displaying the array using jsx
  When we play the game

1. We get a generated set of cards - what initiates this? A start/reset button
2. We can pick a card
3. We pick another card
4. Not a match
5. So they get flipped over
